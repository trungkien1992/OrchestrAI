# Context Plugin: Provider-Agnostic AI Orchestration Tool

## Features
- Integrates with OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and more
- Pluggable provider interface for any AI API
- Centralized API key and provider management
- Unified CLI for orchestration, completion, and workflow

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -e ./packages/context_plugin
```

### 2. Set your provider and API key
```bash
python -m claude_code_plugin.cli.commands set-key
# Or with options:
python -m claude_code_plugin.cli.commands set-key --provider openai --api-key sk-...
```

### 3. Run a test completion
```bash
python -m claude_code_plugin.cli.commands complete --prompt "Write a Python function to add two numbers."
```

## Adding a New Provider
- Implement a subclass of `AIProvider` in `ai_providers/`
- Register it in `provider_factory.py`

## Environment Variables
- `AI_PROVIDER`: Provider name (e.g., openai, anthropic, groq)
- `AI_API_KEY`: API key for the selected provider

## Extending Workflows
- Use the provider interface in orchestration engines for coding workflows
- Add new CLI commands for advanced orchestration
